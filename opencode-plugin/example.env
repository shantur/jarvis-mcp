# Example environment configuration for OpenCode Voice Interface Plugin

# Voice Interface Port (matches the HTTPS port from MCP Voice Interface)
MCP_VOICE_INTERFACE_PORT=5114

# Voice Interface URL (HTTPS default with automatic self-signed certificate handling)
VOICE_INTERFACE_URL=https://localhost:5114

# Polling interval in milliseconds (how often to check for voice messages)
VOICE_POLL_INTERVAL=2000

# Maximum number of messages to process per polling cycle
VOICE_MAX_MESSAGES=5

# Enable debug logging for troubleshooting
VOICE_DEBUG=true

# Alternative configurations for different setups:

# For HTTP fallback (not recommended, only if HTTPS fails):
# VOICE_INTERFACE_URL=http://localhost:5113

# For faster polling (more responsive but higher CPU usage):
# VOICE_POLL_INTERVAL=1000

# For slower polling (less responsive but lower CPU usage):
# VOICE_POLL_INTERVAL=5000

# To process more messages at once (faster clearing but potential delays):
# VOICE_MAX_MESSAGES=10

# For production (disable debug logging):
# VOICE_DEBUG=false
