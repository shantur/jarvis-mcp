## How to Use

1. **Start the server** - Run `mcp-voice-interface`
2. **Open browser** - Visit `https://localhost:5114` (opens automatically)
3. **Allow microphone** - Grant permissions when prompted
4. **Start talking** - Use the `converse` tool in your AI assistant

Use the converse tool to start talking:
- converse("Hello! How can I help you today?", timeout: 35)
```

## Browser Interface

The web interface provides:

- **Voice Settings** (click ‚öôÔ∏è to expand)
  - Language selection (30+ options)
  - Voice selection
  - Speech speed control
  - Always-on microphone mode
  - Silence detection sensitivity & timeout (for Whisper streaming)
- **Smart Controls**
  - Pause during AI speech (prevents echo)
  - Stop AI when user speaks (natural conversation)
- **Mobile Friendly** - Works on phones and tablets

## Remote Access

Access from any device on your network:

1. Find your computer's IP: `ifconfig | grep inet` (Mac/Linux) or `ipconfig` (Windows)
2. Visit `https://YOUR_IP:5114` on your phone/browser
3. Accept the security warning (self-signed certificate)
4. Grant microphone permissions

Perfect for continuing conversations away from your desk!

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
export MCP_VOICE_AUTO_OPEN=false  # Disable auto-opening browser
export MCP_VOICE_HTTPS_PORT=5114  # Change HTTPS port
export MCP_VOICE_STT_MODE=whisper  # Switch the web app to Whisper streaming
export MCP_VOICE_WHISPER_URL=http://localhost:12017/v1/audio/transcriptions  # Whisper endpoint (full path)
export MCP_VOICE_WHISPER_TOKEN=your_token  # Optional Bearer auth for Whisper server
```

### Whisper Streaming Mode

- Whisper mode records raw PCM in the browser, converts it to 16 kHz mono WAV, and streams it through the built-in HTTPS proxy, so the local `whisper-server` sees OpenAI-compatible requests.
- The UI keeps recording while transcripts are in flight and ignores Whisper‚Äôs non-verbal tags (e.g. `[BLANK_AUDIO]`, `(typing)`), so only real speech is queued.
- To enable it:
  1. Run your Whisper server locally (e.g. `whisper-server` from `pfrankov/whisper-server`).
  2. Set the environment variables above (`MCP_VOICE_STT_MODE=whisper` and the full `MCP_VOICE_WHISPER_URL`).
  3. Restart `mcp-voice-interface` and hard-refresh the browser (empty-cache reload) to load the streaming bundle.
  4. Voice status (`voice_status()` tool) now reports whether Whisper or browser STT is active.

### Ports

- **HTTPS**: 5114 (required for microphone access)
- **HTTP**: 5113 (local access only)

## Requirements

## Troubleshooting

**Certificate warnings on mobile?**
